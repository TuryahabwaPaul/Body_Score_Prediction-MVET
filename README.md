# 🌟 **Body Score Prediction - Team VisionOps** 🌟

Welcome to **Body Score Prediction**, a project by **Team VisionOps** developed for the **M-VET Hackathon**, organized by **Makerere AI Lab** which won Second Place. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to accurately predict body scores from dataset from Lacuna Fund.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for body scoring using a deep learning approach. Utilizing **EfficientNetB0**, we aim to deliver precise predictions while ensuring computational efficiency.

### **Key Sections**:
1. **Necessary Imports**: All essential libraries required for the project.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Efficient management of datasets, focusing on data preparation for model training.
3. **Model Development**: Construction of a robust neural network based on **EfficientNetB0** architecture.
4. **Making Predictions and Submission**: Execution of final predictions and preparation for hackathon submission.

## 🛠️ **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Important Note**: This notebook was run on a **FreeTier Colab T4 GPU**. However, to prevent unexpected crashes, it is preferable to run this notebook in a **Colab Pro or Pro+** account with **higher RAM**.
4. Run the notebook step by step or execute all cells to train the model and make predictions.
